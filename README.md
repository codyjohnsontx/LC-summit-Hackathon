# ‚òïÔ∏è Wi-Fi Coffee Finder

A self-contained full-stack Single-Page Application for discovering coffee shops with great internet speeds. Built entirely with **React Router v7 ‚Äì Framework Mode**, it uses route-level loaders and actions in place of a traditional REST API or Express server.

---

## Tech Stack

‚Ä¢ React 19 (via Vite)
‚Ä¢ React Router v7 Framework Mode ‚Äì data loaders & actions, automatic type-gen  
‚Ä¢ TypeScript everywhere  
‚Ä¢ Tailwind CSS for styling  
‚Ä¢ **lowdb** (file-backed JSON) for persistence ‚Äì no external DB needed

---

## What It Does

1. **Authentication** ‚Äì Local-only registration and login.
2. **Coffee Shop Directory** ‚Äì List all caf√©s with average download/upload speeds and community votes (üëç / üëé).
3. **Dashboards & Details** ‚Äì Add new shops, view shop details, submit speed tests, cast thumbs-up or thumbs-down votes.
4. **Data Driven by Routes** ‚Äì All reads/writes run through React Router `loader()` and `action()` functions, eliminating separate API endpoints.
5. **File-based Persistence** ‚Äì Data is stored in `db/db.json` so you can inspect or reset the app easily.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install deps (includes lowdb)
npm install

# 2. Run the dev server (auto-regenerates route types)
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Scripts

| Script              | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Start Vite dev server + React Router HMR |
| `npm run typecheck` | Generate route types & run `tsc`         |
| `npm run build`     | Produce production build (`build/`)      |
| `npm start`         | Serve the production build               |

## Data Schema (`db/db.json`)

```json
{
  "users": [{ "id": "uuid", "username": "alice", "password": "plaintext" }],
  "coffeeShops": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Blue Bottle",
      "location": "NYC",
      "createdBy": "userId",
      "votes": { "userId": 1, "anotherId": -1 }
    }
  ],
  "speedTests": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "coffeeShopId": "uuid",
      "download": 150.2,
      "upload": 30.4,
      "createdAt": "2025-06-11T18:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "userId"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment

Because it's just a Node process serving a Vite/React Router build, you can deploy it anywhere:

‚Ä¢ Docker, Fly.io, Railway, DigitalOcean, Render, etc.  
‚Ä¢ Or run locally in Electron / as a desktop app (all data stays in JSON file).

---

## Contributing / TODOs

‚Ä¢ Hash passwords (never store plaintext in production).  
‚Ä¢ Pagination & search for many coffee shops.  
‚Ä¢ Real-world speed-test integration (e.g., Speedtest CLI).  
‚Ä¢ User avatars & profile pages.  
‚Ä¢ PWA / offline mode.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è & caffeine using React Router v7.
